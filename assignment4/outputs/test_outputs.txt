You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for the kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, at the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom and the kids that I saved my life.
She saved my life as I was allowed to go into the bathroom <unk>
I was making it on a secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to begin to work in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could go down to Ohio and please bring that guy that I know you've been found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day, we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because he was
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a <unk> box and put it into my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told them became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved the top of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water around the water -- almost 60 meters. And I couldn't think that it was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up the end of the end, whereas others can't be <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing a <unk>
As a iceberg melts there it releases fresh freshwater in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and they will not exist in the way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has more than 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to get to witness a <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starting to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg in average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the <unk> shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby -- OK.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about it, you won't pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this scenario I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> and sperm gets together to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground in my ground to get two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that I do in my work is the one of an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology didn't fit in male sketches and conventional women.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't happen in a male or a <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is called the <unk> gene.
And then in life -- the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome."
So, there are high levels of testosterone but not reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a typically <unk> course.
When we <unk> the baby has a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
Then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like the men, we have in the body -- something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his structure, I believe being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> of <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and she was wearing a life as a boy and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had chromosomes in the uterus and the uterus -- the <unk> glands, they were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male component typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> no one <unk>
And it went to the 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, you have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't really know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
And the reason that it comes to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> being black, means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A <unk> idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very divergent ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept, very romantic.
So imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within a single body.
The most recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to wonder, "What do you have to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is not such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought that these categories -- that we thought were a stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science, we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all the spheres of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which one body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside <unk> when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of a lot like it was a pen in front of the nose and if I moved it still not to do it.
If I stopped moving around it.
But today, we can, for example, extract a vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining really somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be indifferent to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with a very unusual body, but I have to admit that I put up nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
It was <unk> from the concept point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fan of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every bit of looking at that <unk> music, and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
Parents -- they were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell me why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our Founding <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a father's right to the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Parents -- so many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed away from a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And when they were spreading the idea of the <unk> coincidence, <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the base of the future of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened in next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color people are going to go from the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we have certain <unk>
But look, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> in the anatomy.
I don't mean by the age of five years to have to allow sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, at the other hand, was born in term: born on March 1 March 1980.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, all of the virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered to be a man now is <unk> the adoption of which Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on their hand, does not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories, which in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down both in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't have <unk> tests to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you about the beginning of the Yentl syndrome?
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> speech, "I have a solution.
It says that we should be judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for providing rights to people, because I would admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the contents of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me ask me what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI one.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current thinking of thinking about democracy today.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian when a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to be willing to stand in a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins and then pick them apart, and so they took their name.
But when the phone was asked by the <unk> of the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to.
What I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change the good of the state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to finish over, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a neuroscientist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about it.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in asking the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- on average, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in college, one of my contention that I knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the <unk> stereotypes -- so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about his question, the more I have found me on the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the women's brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the fathers were very easy to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth more than their building cost.
So we could easily translate the world to the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just would go through buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartment they could be owners and the other half is still unable to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> of the building and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a completely new apartment building that always is always and when the rules of that place will be able to put it into <unk>
So I suggested that the governments would make new reform areas for holding cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk> cities.
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
And in the next elections, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this concept of cities under <unk> to the most essential.
The first point was the importance of the standards, such as those rules that say you can't go and sing, to all current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs both of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually these are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent me to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, "We will take this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> land, which in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, and this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk back to the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince them that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained the <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that could go to that could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away into the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders of <unk> would need help of <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that everyone could trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could take a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional motive that allowed to create these special special regions.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the vote in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the parties, all the activists in society, <unk>
In the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, it passed another time to another voting on <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting at 24 to 24 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third one.
And if you think about it anyway, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and it would allow it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be committed to the end of the last instance is that this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go on the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go and get a job, sometimes they have to make their money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, I love and more recently photograph and publishing in my blog and colorful and different for each occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is second hand of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I am going to meet people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> My look at me and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Being my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> so I feel I've won.
So back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what it was for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought it seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
It's inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know me like the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you now the data for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost be <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> I took <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just tell you, you are also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child on the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're looking good at something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see it well with anything, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and the outside and you don't see that you can't be <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people came up with this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
All of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to <unk> emotionally to these things, because the way back in the corner, there will always be another crazy suit. <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be completely logical.
This would be a totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them are <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a huge <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need fairly intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
So we put them to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and it didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking bar I taught him a precious lesson, and that is that the big things not allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for particle physicist, because they don't play with parking car bars and they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit it well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it should not should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to broaden it a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal little <unk> with a springboard and that <unk> supported by a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip that I went to work with all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this bore hole in a swimming event that is found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator -- I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to put all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled it out all the air and pull it into a temperature at least a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you stand in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as way.
So we measure their movement.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it was like a breathing was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case -- all <unk> of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
Over the rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you well?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you work your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and turned the lights and look into the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics that it says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, and it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
It was <unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we form a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
They better show me the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done for their launch.
So, let's <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the art art museum in New York.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
Would you like to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the flat, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the hallway,
keep going. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> by Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click it here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million of the pixel today.
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really have to do with 10,000 million of the pixel here.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things fun that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to have a <unk>
So I started play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found out that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a stick on a stick on a stick on the Tuesday Tuesday, of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep, and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to let you see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and it really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another thing of my favorite function.
There are lots of things more here, but I don't have time from <unk>
This is the really cool thing. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go on -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital digital does it do justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is: "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> an <unk>
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I am from Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there has happened something very interesting about adult careers in the last two decades.
Now some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I took a budget and you would get it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you get the good thing.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the real control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're coming back to the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As well. I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer <unk>
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
So in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms will become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer, and he threw it on the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> a <unk> and he said yelling out, <unk> <unk> and so what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a bit of <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of this.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, and <unk> and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line line is at the top.
At the sooner early there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick phone call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yes!
That night they were all at <unk>
You see the big summit.
The next day, they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the equivalent of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some little stickers tags to track the trash on their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all <unk>
Then we put them a little chip, one <unk> in the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of fun.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> does not be there somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> it is still still still on there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change in <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water in public space, in the architecture.
And the question was, how do technology can, the new technology, put on to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you take the pixels you can write in them, I'll show patterns, pattern texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
It loved it.
And you have a commission to design the building to the input of the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no <unk> <unk> but when you come up with it opens up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture is gone, like in this case.
Those days always will be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it comes down the whole architecture is gone.
This is working.
You see the people <unk> so it goes on.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to prove the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was really more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still making and holes in water, and you had to jump out for <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people giving our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and every one of you had a little pixel -- which changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears on different scales and size, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down.
When the light lights off, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancing dancers of today, the New York star in New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can push the whole movement.
You can go down the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our environment -- like an oyster nursery like the calf of <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years, is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world in the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Now for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move the digital world out of the digital world, the self-organizing power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people get involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel down.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover of the pixel cover of it.
You can move around the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom for sharing the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> in the night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
They would like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you might improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
What about a good health?
Or maybe be from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that I <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would they have creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Ah, most of them makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or may be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today, I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great episode of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "No biology, it makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, it is, of course, the more interest we do.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
We have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few <unk> years.
It may seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take on the more bacteria that the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark, cubes is very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that might want to be <unk>
It's really like a quick way for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk>
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or was meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you have <unk>
When I just went back to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell divide and all the genetic energy of that cell cell is transmitting to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms come out, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of your body death comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I was going, every single single <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits their door <unk>
He opens the door.
And in front of it, he finds a little lightweight dancer.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "It says, George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal for the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us healthy.
I wanted to regain the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden on the next level of <unk> and then we will let us go to the sea.
I think everyone else is saying Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily support longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even more smart.
Evolution favors the best <unk> creatures in their environment.
That's the only survival test for survival and successful.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in the <unk> yet have managed to do that an environment <unk>
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the right stage, I would argue that there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that they don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for that as well as we adapt ourselves to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for this evolution.
A second possibility is that it is going to produce a natural type of natural type of brain -- that's dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a <unk> planets -- distant planets go to the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a possibility and intriguing and terrifying one.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex from your <unk> but in their own body to do the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost to 20,000 dollars and <unk>
There is not very much for us to make the human genome -- the human genome -- and it will be more and more the grasp of all.
Those are those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they will induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells in a plant plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change cell cells but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg, and giving their children a better chance of a healthy life remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can make changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to have to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could afford it with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of setting this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take a hundred thousand years and we can put it at 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more successful options.
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that will be more boring and more robust.
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom you need to make these decisions.
For a good way, and before what it might be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to with <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You can probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot would take the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't make it all the fences that I have wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought more ahead, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I will open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as it <unk> the George Washington bridge, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that it didn't care with people that do matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason -- it's not to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is going to <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break down in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went back, I had the feeling of that guy, I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is focused on a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent.  And I scream, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understand that two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they are going to be expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does their relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis of it.
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, and so obviously, graffiti is something <unk> we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you can see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are someone important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're doing it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced me with the only desire to deliver a check and instead signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to happen.
And I met his brother and her father in that very precise time, "All right, this is what Tony is going to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on their interior cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a lasers, draw about that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving the things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine to make it <unk> I could give you a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I'm talking to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers across the world of every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we would do something completely stupid and that when they were going to have taken off the squares of the walls and it would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> walk on my dog -- my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of cheap sun that we buy in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> and Radio <unk>
So we took a camera camera, we put it into an LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds yourself -- we published the code -- the software is low in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There are no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming intense sessions at night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back to draw for his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time it was a fit in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and let me get me out there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
It sort of is our airport for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it is the equivalent of a postage stamp.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to make it more quickly and robust.
We've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel to do. If it's not right now, I think, if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in situations in very difficult situations and at the same time a dangerous one.
I went to the difficult <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
Literally, in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days of eating a lot of fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in situations in situations in situations in situations with the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that you have to have interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that would be <unk> and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered at sale for the name of my TEDTalk on 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do that.
But that said this, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of name.
If you had asked me a year ago I couldn't have been able to do with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been in situations in situations in the last few years, but nothing could happen to me. It could be <unk> for something so dangerous or as dangerous as I enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that try to make a film that try to make a film that the <unk> and the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film, never <unk> is that everything up at the bottom of the end, and it has <unk> images -- all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title of the title of the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people have been transferred to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. It's <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I mean, it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> but we're going to make sure that we will put all the categories that we could in the film.
You might give it a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in the largest film ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is to try to show the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That is the whole idea of it, all the film, from beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear it, is the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it is going to <unk> <unk>     David <unk> how much money does it takes to do this?
MS: It's a million and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half million -- I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth presenting a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie comes out and look at us as a whole bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be difficult for me for the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: ... I'm not optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think of what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so this was one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media scenario is not the idea of counting with that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> mistake -- and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin:
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the CEOs the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really hard change suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want it to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me looking at me, like, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there is the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wants to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my mind, I would have to take out of my mind and go to business and go to business with all my team.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big, giant movies and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies -- giant movies say that the reason their films have so much success is because of the brands associated they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to get you wrong.
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> <unk> to <unk> whatever.
That's the big picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that <unk> are more good at a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind the people that are the reason why we care about it.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to be in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man on the street to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Brian <unk> My <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: It will revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay, what is the <unk>
<unk> One is only <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and so on.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like sunglasses, and I like the crystals and the like.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Some of them are <unk> partly <unk> partly -- partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> Tom, but I would often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If you could do it for them, they could surely be able to do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings that you be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think that your world is the world as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: Next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like things weird stuff. I like things weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that do?
What is the <unk> What do you find now?
Why is it? What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid. What kind of roller coaster are you?
MS: Stop. <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> One, Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality -- Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I believe that some companies just fall into one of their strong spots or on the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not allowed to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them to accommodate and make a nice thing to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands that things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your design identity, your personality -- what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are someone who makes blood <unk>
Or you're rather an attribute of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes is like being playful as being playful as the <unk> contemporary and <unk> and bold and bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic like <unk>
Or are you more attribute of <unk>
Are you <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You are traditional established, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, familiar, safe, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise people like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, you would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
All over the city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting in the way in schools in schools in the United States.
The great thing to me is that the projects I have had the greatest response or that I have more successful are those in the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> <unk> they took their donor agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They didn't succeed?
Well, since the film was sent in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, neither TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online in line.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about is giving their clients not to be <unk>
I have always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that being pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees on the loss of risk is preparing for their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And that said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> has <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED Media Lab, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software from <unk> they're from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus out of Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enter the gray box <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these pictures, these control systems.
That was called us the attention -- and we started an experiment where we were going to <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
And so they got very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> -- the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
You don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, for example, an energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
They better get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the <unk> code, and we found that it was <unk> in two pumps and a big one.
We also saw that they were <unk> very <unk> by people who obviously had the entire internal data.
It takes all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for was called the system of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential world goals in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely an violent <unk> it must be a <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find a number of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to go crazy to the nest maintenance engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> by looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> is <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would look at one and the same goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we are very confident that we have determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we really saw -- I really get stuck.
There's the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is intercept the input values of sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and it provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with the false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital security systems, where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is going on speed, you need to open valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And you don't have the <unk> and the security system would be <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a key key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
<unk> the more possible.
And if you made that, what you do with is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better deal with that we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in a lot of sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the engine behind this is the superpower behind this.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give <unk> skills, or another one that makes chairs of lawn chairs and raise them to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, it gives you a great force in the morning, which is also increasing your speed, and help you drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other discoveries <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, needs to carry on your back a <unk> load up of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to bring you even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal Universal Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 kilos on variables for a lot of hours.
His flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the <unk> users of the wheels, about what I am particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people who are in chairs in the world around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with damage to the spinal column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We are also talking about the population that are blown up quickly.
His only option, often -- by a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so much for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who's done 19 years ago that he had a injury on the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
You have sensors -- it has some sensors here.
It was completely <unk> in crutches and send signals to board, here on the back.
There are also a couple of batteries that give you energy in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move away with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top.
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole feeling and all the movement of all <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> you will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it to the last ounce of hope that I will be.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs to <unk> climbing rocks and even ride on the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit and talk to you with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life for generations -- not just by soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the chairs of chairs from the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest closest experiences.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a very emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the <unk> survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> of hunting hunting and deforestation, make it not be able to fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden -- the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to deal with conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a student game.
For us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human told.
The game is the glue that we come together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has taken the <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves her, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is largely in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
And the game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with no water.
I think, as it does, sometimes we played the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's the playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get it to the maximum capacity of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate work, you can be the moments where the most urgent thing is.
And so fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a non-profit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, you know, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers come to a highly skilled staff. You have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a very high probability of going.
But yet there was a career to stand against the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain and figure out what our job was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that was definitely going through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the middle night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to go and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be in the house.
I need you to be able to give you the fire, and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the <unk> firemen that at that height more or less had finished off the fire and went into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the house where, as it was to expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the owner of the owner of the <unk> to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer fireman I am witness of generosity and kindness acts at a <unk> scale, but also from grace of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are that you have to do remarkable levels of success at what I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you right now.
We had food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the chance to save the life of someone but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So I enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, concrete modules that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They've allowed us to build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges or bridges a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to all the homes.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 kilometers per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
It was simply taken on the concrete block of this, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a aesthetic bricks stacked over each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block of this, the transistor allows you to create a much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about it is they attach by magnets.
So you can't get it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the ground, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits in.
One blue with one green produce light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really powerful.
Instead of having to program, and connect and <unk> <unk> to allow us to program using very simple gestures,
To make <unk> faster or more slow, you simply turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to get together to use ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> it all must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how do you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night light works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers have no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island School that they have no experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and paper and said, Do something.
Here's an example of a project that have made, a <unk> cannon on the movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So I go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment focused on the focus on focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I've got the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to do, we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
I got a few members every year and put them on the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them the wild world <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a New York City <unk>
Here it appears as if I was looking for a quote, but what it really seeks is that somebody else has to clean it, when it is left off the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning out fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we had a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks just in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
When you do so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
So it has a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the youngest of 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other government technology <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible system of <unk> city systems, when you see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for the citizens to reach the <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people were stealing the batteries.
So he asks the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just was <unk> to make people go clean to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we have to use using it.
And this has spread <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that he was done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two years and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the judicial court power that even time has two million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that comes in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of shot post to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not like in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather than the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an immune institution, but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we get together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we stop side to the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone is not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics don't have the government yes.
And because the government at the last instance are starting from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it thought about it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of <unk> and information <unk>
It's the place that calls the calls if you're <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> This call.
He joined the official knowledge base.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors out of the house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We didn't have that app.
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Office of New York City <unk>
And one day, this really has happened -- it comes up with my trash bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to a distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition technology of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to move and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected two people.
And I could have put them connected to the government services, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entry of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will promote our values and we don't see that changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
At underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it is that <unk> which is that it belongs to us that we will have that financed as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and at consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy, be sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
This is a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the financial reform project on the financial reform.
That's not political activism that is activism that is <unk>
And so for those of us who have <unk> ourselves to the government, it's time to ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible for the root of root the government function so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so that I, to <unk> I'm a greater generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem is, they don't really care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They put their hands into the work to make applications that do better work better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from <unk> <unk> a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and so many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers -- not only consumers of government that pay and get services and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a swarm of voices, or we will also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and in death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family in a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in <unk> on the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was little and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and he said, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, it was going back to me, and if I told him that I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it and I looked at it, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, and I took my hand and he said, "Come on. The two are <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, "I will tell you something, but you can't tell it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know that. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you know?
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> the <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said to me, "Do the second thing I want to tell you, is that you are always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "All the third thing I want you to do, is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in <unk> village, I have a brother a year old and a sister a year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We barely have to do the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today, you can always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And I went to my gaze with force and <unk> "Oh, not to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is being <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it by the power that you have to identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My guys were killed from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, they find so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One in three black holes in the age of 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is about much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting to me.
We're looking at our work in some of a very curious developments here.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights, if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to the vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of water loss will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they are sentence to 13-year-old children in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility to come out before.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense we've been interested in thinking that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in the United States is defined by mistake.
Of every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent that is innocent and released from death row.
A mistake, <unk> a innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to fly airplanes if every nine one that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history -- I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted until the Second World War.
We actually don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are more people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, and makes people say that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time we have to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs me work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people realized that they couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's very disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We could never be able to have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "No way that we have our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> were to <unk>
Tell me about this.
How would we feel like a nation where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things, the good things that are positive and wonderful things are, but <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love the entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both of them.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never get to TED.
If you think about them, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It is true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so engaged with the intellectual,
And development comes out with creativity -- development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also for the convictions of the heart.
This connection from the mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just at the bright and <unk> but also the tough thing to do.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no related disconnect with technology and design, that allow us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to assume that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered just to speak.
Occasionally, he called me to be called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and make it.
I was like, "Be lady. I know I do."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, please tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in justice administration.
We try to end the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We're trying to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> put my finger on the face, and he said, "Is it so that you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge by our technology, for our design or our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, they are <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were told as adults do.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what is not it?
The judge does it as an adult, but I see a kid.
One very late night I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't are, you have to have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> client. He had a tiny, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated like a privileged white white white <unk>
In the <unk> I put there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream -- or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally -- "Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. I walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "Is you <unk> Is you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I stood up in the ear, in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I got in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> I said, "Well, I went to you."
People started to go. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The police police have <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I was looking at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black guy with a face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
A few 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he showed me because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood on his feet, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> room to tell this young man to keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the eye on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You're trying to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
So something is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort to take away the funds that you spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes are not at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law come out to the security law.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the largest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is this?
And actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes in violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
This is why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against <unk> rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about this today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some clips I got in the last six months, could be in the last six days or the last six years or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would rather be able to call it negative news -- negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing matters more than survive, the first standing of all that data is an ancient piece of time called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and <unk> all the information looking for something in the environment that could be hurt.
So a <unk> of stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all the digital devices give us bad news for the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> -- no doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just have with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> income per capita income has <unk> all over the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy came from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> phone, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so many of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My great friend -- Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law Act, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and <unk> in recession, in <unk>
It's the end of rapid computers used to build faster computers.
It stops to any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it will curve it up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> they call infinite computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize <unk> and distribute production all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory at "Jeopardy" from Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline they <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, does not mean to create life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
This is about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason the top of the 9/11 is of aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure weapons.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy shortage,
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet -- for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of the energy in every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the sunlight will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy also we have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan has pointed to the Earth on the Earth, in 1990, after it was <unk>
<unk> a famous photo <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of the water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice, and we fought for the water <unk> but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to take your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate 1,000 gallons of drinking water to the day of any clean source -- saltwater, contaminated water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just begun to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that is okay, and I have full confidence where it will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the phones in the developing world of 2013.
<unk> that bionic warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images of books and music, technology diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to come in when it comes to health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are going to challenge the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> they can be <unk> you can be able to be able to be able to be able to get blood of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
So you can imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent, and there are health care workers.
When this <unk> device a virus of RNA or DNA that we didn't call the <unk> and the first place, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion growing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the mark from the 7 billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds ever before you add up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you say? What would you <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D data and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever ever before.
What can you provide three billion members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and they can act for first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that teams and guided by his passion with an objective of course, can do things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
You have played with this particular university professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machine recognition machinery is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to be able to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the great passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we need to do.
We have a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea may be explained in a minute, I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
It was caught very much until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, a lot of times about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it might be <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition by the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There was <unk> about 20 percent of the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he made it more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined in half.
I went back to the five centimeters high.
We have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing is changed, but it's all changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- it started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very bad boat, it was called <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Ross Sea and, above all, in the Ross Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of a little bit of <unk> remains of a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came down and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom is going to be a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they've never had fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world but we don't remember it.
It was going to start the starting point to start to start a new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things -- biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of it, remains.
And that, in big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when anonymous societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very plentiful, before we <unk> it is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You have a little <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focused on big animals, and in a big sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With the few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a captain of the way I watched a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally use the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From the enormous paper that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas we actually <unk> the past.
Let's find the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West West, for example?
I think that arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A lot of time ago there were a long time ago in the bay bay -- 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people are going to be moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do we deal with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to motivate us to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that looked very, very hard.
But today the video video does that any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of course, just a small percentage of it, get a tremendous percentage of views and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of communities of participation and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this black video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the rise of the last year of last summer.
He didn't talk to you a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if you're called Mountain <unk>
And I had published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> we present new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>
<unk> of 24 Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video appeared to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this <unk> <unk>
Well, I took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of Science Science was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends will take a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people that shares this great internal joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 kilometers of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's all it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know that there is a three-year-old version that has seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody did an ancient version of it.
And then it became international
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> that made it happen to be a dumb joke to something we can all form a lot.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Black <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written by this situation?
In a world in which two days of video you go up two days of video for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me he had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in it.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent them properly from <unk>
KA: Thank the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> made it five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The trend of trend, creative communities of participation, the absolutely unexpected, are features of a new media media -- from a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started YouTube.
Don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's barely the current media -- but <unk> the future entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
This is a poet, a <unk> whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom from their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally on vain.
The words, for so much time friends, now they <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years when his father died, and marriage marriage and two little girl.
To her, life had been meant to a <unk> task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea and put it <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The most popular fear was the rape and rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we first asked us, we would first take it for my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are of that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast vast and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the free engine and not being able to start with six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and eventually finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried to be given by the men on the platform.
No apple had had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations -- shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> which is composed of immigrant
Unlike the middle suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in an <unk> line of cars, working six days long.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and that was established the extra tutoring in English and mathematical <unk> wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be, which was generally <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
One is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares would start to be able to be able to be able to get a <unk>
She opened a computers, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the relentless classic shoes.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically embarrassed by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many people got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the young Australian woman in the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't get <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire the <unk> and the comfort of life in a particular suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters just ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> about the day of each one and <unk> <unk> three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do that.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
The "no" ever had been an option.
<unk> said to me, what do you not <unk>
So I talked about youth <unk> and education and education and <unk> to the Orchestra.
And the more I talked about, the more I talked about it more was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing -- living on the edge of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new <unk> and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave them enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, an optimism <unk> a mixed mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
It was going to be a small group of people who the slogan cannot be <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
It goes down to well at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
I took the choice to move to the U.S.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the <unk> in a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a Buddhist came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
Have you not <unk>
If there's a nerve on our family, that runs through the women.
Since we were and how life we built us now can see that the men that have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, so brave in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them to make a secure one.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old <unk> <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At that time when we <unk> the great Romantic warrior warrior Indian -- he was <unk> he pulled a bow and with a <unk> on the floor, he would get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The bottom line was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I was excited about this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology was for the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras stopped that <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> me to this technological world to see how it would use to create magic, rather than <unk>
I read books since 16 years old.
So when I saw the iPad I saw an <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
You put the text with the image, animation animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But for what does that do?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  It says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live on GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner little girl are excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that of the childhood <unk> to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies have always turned me exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, you light up your way in which you enjoy the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I move towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of the fantasy book there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and wet book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
And in a history that is about today today like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not come outside the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can pull our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to regain this childhood ritual we have to go out and, in a chapter, <unk> a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then can be put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Within variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video on it, and by <unk> <unk> you see a animated group of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves away.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
So let's go into a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and the technology and the technology are approaching one another.
We have the energy of the sun.
We are moving to our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she lifted a little cup of coffee or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk>
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail since we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and it goes on.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I get married, it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my body problem is, not at the same time when you need the <unk> or some urgency of that style, but see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than four followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I got my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, we will be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to go from their houses, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back and reclaim control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care, because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of care costs are <unk> the <unk> of the demand and other issues.
<unk> these are simple techniques to use and start with this to engage patients at the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video video.
All of us have screens in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> where, when it's open up, because sometimes you open up in <unk> in the office and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the following weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to be <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at the other universities, so that we can help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> this and not just improve health care, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
He mixed with my prior passion, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
Let's see it like this: a building on a very <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say, "That's <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want you to have been captured in some way that photography.
So what you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the basics is very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it was.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process when you combine the photographs.
It's really to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic -- I think they are those in which we don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important -- because it can otherwise be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can make something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> they took the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And in the staff -- I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put it in danger the ideas that have in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made the red house of the island of the island for more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think we need to play.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll begin by showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram -- anybody I took from a mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is this one, like many other ones we tend to see, is a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step of here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It was more intensity because you write about paper.
Why do we make technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve, you know, say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to ask you, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you will, for example, another technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, you have a <unk> change.
If the technology of mass transport technology as fast as we could last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development -- that every few years advance of magnitude.
And the question I want to make -- look at these <unk> curves that we see not just forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We took one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes out -- something totally different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
This line is in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
Where does the world run the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after a year after my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer and computer.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back to a few and a half billion years when the Earth was a big rock with a lot of chemicals going on around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA. So I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it was that, at that time, he had floating around with oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials from the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most popular cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they will have a distributed distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow would be better than the time to bring the chemical chemists to <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a life of life, and it's very simple, but the things got interesting -- when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what it was to be able to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here is 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people at airport security.
But <unk> Tom is this <unk> The code has the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and put it 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants to 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then it occurred to another big step in which things got very different -- and it was that these cells started to swap and communicate information and to communicate information and to communicate information.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's so many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be engaged in that way, and established a <unk>
And that <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community they would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the <unk> point happened when these communities went so long that they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting to life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't work alone.
The skin cell is not the heart of the heart, or the brain cells or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making information in the community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the effective structures of <unk> understanding and transfer information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism I could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time the ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information has accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most compelling version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a little bit of <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> on his heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took a very complicated thing to make it sound in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through similar periods of <unk> organisms, our record methods and data processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so on, it's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where some evolution of evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you to give a billion years each.
The next couple of the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years old.
And the course of the language, the language, they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like the electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make the life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without recent online advances in recent years.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me -- in a conventional way.
I don't know it does every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead of <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that didn't do it, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand it.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those things that are closer to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tidy numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
And we got those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children -- that <unk> <unk> and that kids would have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's put it back again.
We put some mutations around.
And it tries again and tries to go back with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are made up in a perfect way.
In fact, it's programs much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark and strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he picks up a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become messy.
So we started to depend on computers to make a different design design process.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the average engineering.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
So I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog time to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think it will stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time to allow me to give up a part of my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little baseball story.
Why not?
We are near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about coming out <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you have heard of.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without going to be <unk> and that anyone who is trying to engage the first base of it, don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone than 10 <unk> hits four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last NBA League of the League of <unk> at the more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are helpful to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and their family doctor goes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll tell you the question.
What do you believe that must be the average of a heart surgeon, or a heart surgeon, or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, though, is sending them to the world, and they included, with the <unk>
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a bilingual student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studying until a blood test.
You know.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the University of the nurses at the General of Toronto, not from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> for every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medicine school with the impression that if you were to hear everything, then it would know everything, or the more possible thing about the everything, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady into the emergency service service where I worked.
At the time I got assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied the emergency room to a cardiologist hit that patient.
And I'm going to tell the chief <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what struck me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment of the treatment for me.
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure on his heart.
He gave them <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two mistakes more.
She sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> him with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring a lot of data on.
Maybe I made it for a good reason.
And maybe I didn't want to be a resident who would get constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even to contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it home to his house, he didn't take attention to a voice on my insides that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure to her to the nurse that he was <unk> to the <unk> she thinks it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it signed up the tall, and the ambulance together with the ambulance they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, I had a bad <unk>
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, it was <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So I did something I didn't do normally,
I went through the emergency room service at home.
And there another nurse, not the one who was <unk> from the lady who was <unk> but the other. He told me three words -- those three words that most emergency physicians were <unk>
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: does you remember this?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour, he came home to his house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance they brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure, which means a shock attack.
barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency room will bring all their resources.
They gave him medications to raise your blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three years later, it was obvious that they never <unk>
It had permanent <unk> damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let them go. Mrs. wife, <unk> mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the few weeks later, I took care for that, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone without feeling that healthy shame because you can't do it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more committed that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And it did.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure to take the things and made sure I didn't get stuck.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I put it home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did they choose medicine?
Shortly that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day it was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me where if I get the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, I would do with those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work, and I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital, north of Toronto, and I got a 25 man in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
He used here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door still <unk> his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head asked to speak with me in his office.
And I made the three words: Remember that?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, but from the throat, and it can cause the close to those tracks.
And luckily, he didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics because it goes down to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until it happened over and over and over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> it wasn't <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it would be served to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't believe them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
He took an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out -- a colleague who was looking at the patient -- some sensitivity at the lower right quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And he ordered the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I did it.
I looked at it, and when I noticed some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, he called a surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But each of the case was <unk>
But I would like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I went back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party, you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> which make mistakes and the ones that are not allowed to sleep and the ones that I know have <unk> results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take the drug from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a secure system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and journalism, I have done a personal study of bad medical research and medical errors to learn how to learn how we could from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto of "Star <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where antiangiogenic infections, are increasingly right, and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 8,000 Canadian <unk> by errors in medical mistakes.
U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> of the <unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I push it to alcohol and all of a sudden my story <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things like that.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to be wrong, good, you won't get any one.
And I know that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> art.
And their students were <unk> <unk> and <unk> and they would start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
Your medical doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, they accept it and not proud of your mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
I would give the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, I'm going to be <unk>
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember that.
Do you know how many choices we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick a half a half a day.
Not a lot ago, in a research followed for a week of presidents and a group of presidents in business.
The researchers recorded all the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that they were trying to make things related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, each work included many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How is the <unk> how they deal with those decisions?
Today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question in the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> at the Stanford University, the very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we made water from the tap.
I loved going to that tent, but I asked myself, why I never buy anything?
This is a shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones who were in box <unk> who came from trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and asked her, "Is this strategy to give all these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
So hall.
They had different classes.
I took a post for <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or from 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had taken a 60 percent, that when I had only six 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Those who stopped when he had finished, only three percent came to buy <unk>
When I stood when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a good thing to be good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of options of choices are affecting us in good <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even though we don't care about it.
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings decisions for retirement about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the older was the number of educational funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you have more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more it was the number of choices, more people would be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
In the time there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize human financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three primary negative consequences of the more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively to go better.
The main reason is that we are looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
So today, I want to give you four simple techniques that we are <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can try in your business.
The first one is <unk>
You have heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, than less is more.
People always get angry when I say, <unk>
Would you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, to get rid of odd options, odd options, there will be an increase in sales, you have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> to 15, they saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation took me to just eliminated the products for <unk> that you get <unk> they grew up <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that today's shelves in average, provide 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there is about 100,000 products.
But the last largest store in the present world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have come on about how to handle the choices is the invention of David <unk> the <unk>
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a insurance fund of life.
Those people really want to choose to choose them, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday on a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause. If you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really hit hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second turn, but I can tell you that the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> <unk> problem which is <unk>
So people understand the differences between choices, have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must have to feel very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent to 30 percent more on average when you use credit cards or credit cards than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added to do was that we would give up the staff that would think about the positive things that they were talking about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> account.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in supermarket supermarkets across the corridor of the <unk> the Stanford exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> exhibitions here.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But, you know something?
This scheme of classification is totally useless.
Now, the categories must indicate something that you have to do not that <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
You're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase creative complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision in the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that allow it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to build your car.
And these are <unk> in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
We had four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order that make the decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, a few different boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
How close you are.
If you will, always the default button in each decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did is disrupt the order that the information is presented.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of the change is not about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we are building that now has more <unk> in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've told you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who help them.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East Germany in the East Germany <unk> if you had a computer write machine.
I had to record a picture of text written with the machine.
And this for government could trace the origin of the texts.
If they found a <unk> the wrong message could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and printing a page, that page is going to end with a few dots on the print on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases in the bottom line, which would make money on their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret secret of the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> <unk> is <unk>
And I say today more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most crime crime in line.
The second group of <unk> that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that the moves, they motivate you the protests, they motivate you to motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that make it to protest and the last group are the national America, governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the fall of the last fall because of a <unk>
You would have the safety of the site and take a <unk>
Last week I asked the last week with representative of the Dutch government -- I asked one of the leaders if I was <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the heart of <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a <unk> attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
How do we serve <unk>
Well, you need to have a website and you have a website for <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority called foreign authority.
And that gave us <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt was the headquarters at the headquarters of the British secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools for governments to make this to their citizens.
But Western governments do also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a <unk> case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They will get the Internet on the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely with things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it looks bad -- but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right to give you today, it will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the South Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the bottom of the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at the night, and so soon we got up in the morning, and we found it dead because I was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
They were dead warriors that protect our community and won, and they also are angry with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for her father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought to the lions give them fear.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because I even helped lions see the <unk>
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, and they said, and they said, and they said, and they said, and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day male lions didn't come.
I found that lions have a fear of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch on and I got the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity on the little <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights on.
As you can see, the <unk> turn out because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals on the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You see them, you can see the core, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by all across Kenya, to scares other predators like hooking <unk> and it's also used for <unk> elephants.
And thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a fellowship in one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we set up the lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to do it.
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the lawns of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes going on and told me that someday it would be within you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now like my invention is saving cows of my dad and lions, we can be with male lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on the other electrical inventions here.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a close electrical CA: A close to <unk>
<unk> I know that <unk> <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, once you put it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> every step of my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, is the enemies.
Although I would sometimes ask me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until it all changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of her mother without doing anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned to take care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine was going to go to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during the starvation and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the <unk> of energy, everything around it was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans across <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that in the year I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was made when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I went to the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said questions.
At the end of the <unk> one official told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people may be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
I was lucky to find out a lot of other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to add to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I realized there was a huge gap between North and South Poles.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm <unk> or I'm <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, and I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just as starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money I sent to my family, and as she passed my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help you escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in some way, over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by an official police officer.
And he asked them all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed myself.
We did the whole way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close to, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask myself, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I was standing with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they get the most.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the hope of hope that the village would need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to get their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices and so on.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us have in contact with family contact, and we sent information and cars that are helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive an international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of fast food, <unk> terrain.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> food, fast terrain.
Just like that, millions of other Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles angels, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to bring people kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart diseases in Los Angeles and South America.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see wheelchair chairs and sold it as a self-driving cars.
I see centers, <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of managing 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has no pesticides with it.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> strip we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet -- it's three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes up with you, given that my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep the maintaining it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us and we started planting our food forest food, trees -- you know, the nine <unk>
What we do, we are kind of a group paid ahead of the gardeners of all the <unk> in the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city came on me and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on.
A court order by planting food in a piece of land that nobody would ever <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it wrong.
Because this time was not going to happen.
The L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
The L.A. is the city of the United States with more gravitational land.
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's a space for planting <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it look like this?
<unk> a plant, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they breed your own food.
<unk> your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land, like a bit of canvas, and the plants and the trees and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the earth can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how astonishing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool in education, moving from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We're the land.
They are <unk> to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter, <unk> were like <unk> at night and they were in my garden. I went out and see very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid that they go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get the <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all on plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the mind and body, eat blind what you put in front of them in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're stuck. I see the color guys that are in this way designed for them, who don't get them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Center.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never shall.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into healthy <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the streets, and that they know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take their <unk> take their <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in chairs and have a meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some crap to talk about making some crap.
If you want to see me, come in the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice highway <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, particularly not in days like today, in which it goes very much.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that you can have <unk>
And especially if they go on on your bicycle and these cars go up, that's not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a <unk>
So the solution for that is to do roads of asphalt roads.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the rainwater flow will flow into the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water and not <unk>
Noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that on this road, the rocks on the surface is out of the surface.
So first one stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage to this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you're going to get <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving on the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool of steel -- that to clean <unk> and we can cut out the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits into the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will turn back to the surface.
Today I used an oven <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here here.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show, which is now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there, and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of <unk> 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> in which we had to do a lane test to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road lasts for several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road, and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put them a lot of payload on them, the letters then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life on the surface of the road, they can even double the life on the surface of it, they really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you the way before I can show you how they look like it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up with a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally was doing it.
<unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning, I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I turned to me as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be out there, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route a different route that nobody could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in market bags.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead of the school suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it was <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It was that his daughter, my mother, my mother, and so his father was <unk>
But my <unk> mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not educating their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life, and she was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can stop your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be going to be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to their daughters, and it was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my university degree, but I also were the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I'm driving through the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream <unk> but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> ambassador for a global campaign to educate the women.
That's why we <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition.
Like <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When he got home, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to it.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people -- there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and who sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
At the <unk> the girls who went to school is <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And so we assume that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I come back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and his parents that I <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream of big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother's who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> as much as the <unk> revolution.
An forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men who were <unk> were in the world: <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying free of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you been showing the <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with a lot of other women, rebuild the civil society -- <unk> a strategic transition and just toward democracy and national intense.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> roughly 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a bit enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> <unk> for <unk> a movement of women, and very supportive and <unk> support, to advocate for the autonomy of the woman and the law of involvement in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of an environment that was increasingly <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections.
However, little to little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day we had the murder of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights rights of prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up of the West mindset, it was <unk> and it's gone away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us with our success of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm very much here today to confess that we, as a nation, choose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't bring the peace, stability and safety to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like <unk>
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than we needed the choices, that we just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the administrative representation of the women who will need to need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be used to it.
We need to stop acting as agents and call it days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which not only enough, but it can also put the weight instead of the <unk> for the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic, which is the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> which spans the entire humanity of the men and women, that every tribes and all the people that all the tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so just like the uterus -- completely covering the <unk> which grows in, the divine matrix, of compassion is all the existence.
This is what it tells you is that "My <unk> is <unk>
This is how he tells us, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That we all get rid of the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a ridiculous question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone makes a bad thing. Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old, I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a revolutionary <unk> <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> from the Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Center.
I'm almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, every religion and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- in the other way, the last place where we would want or expect them to be able to find <unk> for which, abuse, home is so <unk>
I would have told you that would be the last person in the world who was left with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands out in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November January night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also taken away from a college <unk> university and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most struck by that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and that looked like a city guy.
He had some great <unk> like apples and <unk> and <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made it <unk> from the very beginning, was creating the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me, which was list that I went to Harvard, which I went to Harvard, that I was going to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> at that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go out of New York and leave my work from my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I quit <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was coming into a physical <unk> and financial <unk> and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where they come into those <unk>
In the way we moved to New England already -- you know, that site where they were supposed to be <unk> had to feel so safe and bought three <unk>
One had the <unk> in the car.
The other he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of the trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was still serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> occurred five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, so I put my mother <unk> I married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy for always, because I loved it, and he loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of great sense for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never would get hurt.
I spent twice on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that he <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey. It was <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So actually, I had very good company.
So going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> deal with the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't they just <unk>
Why didn't it bother me, could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we have to us, the victims, we know something that normally you are, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in rural violence occur after the victim of the victim after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to her, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation system delivery system to <unk> the victim and their children, which are usually forced by the judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why they're just not doing?
I was able to be able to go, because of a last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world: to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family friends and I am here today because all of you will get me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims of the victims of the victims of <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people that's a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a lesson lesson from what happened to them and that <unk> their lives joyful joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives with completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very <unk>
I went back to marry a nice man, and I got those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever else, ever a charged pistol pointed to my head in someone's hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, they're just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> how stupid, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my particular love, just breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse thrives in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would have the abuse of the light to the light talking about it with their children, their job, their friends and family.
They <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the active signs of violence for intervening <unk> to slow down their climb and show the victims a safety.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have put me dressed in this room like this.  So luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothes on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they come up, they don't have to be <unk> now, but find it later on on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very much less <unk> I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to spend this sweater in the head, because it is when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything in the face of the head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that he would take the back and make it <unk> the <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like that I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always go, <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made it model is because I won the genetics, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking yourself, what is this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage tradition, I've been able to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing you, and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that Google <unk>
First of all, the <unk> by knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that's less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you get older.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take it for that.
But what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or the <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If you after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Steve, I want to be model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've heard your studies, and you have a resume and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you do -- I mean, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but you know, you have to be <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, they pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my soccer team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are <unk> of a professional group of professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: "Do things for free?
I have a lot of <unk> heels.
I grew up at Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me a free dress up.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light on red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
I think of these privileges I don't know what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year from the teenagers who were couple and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
And how many times do I <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair and you have the most brilliant hair and I will feel very happy and feel.
And behind the cameras, we give it an answer that maybe we did it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to work with creative creative people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little bit more thin legs and the more brilliant hair I will be happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brighter hair and the <unk> and the more <unk> women are physically <unk>
But mostly it was difficult to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to keep from this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable than the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was more enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 photographs more <unk> and I didn't have the <unk>
There were no directors and no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very bad care of lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists at random.
My story starts when I was in New York City to give me a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and the 5.
I happened we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can already imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York City on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to take us out the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, never one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific ride.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October and we will think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interacts with everything.
That particular time we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the shop shop that <unk> from the previous <unk>
And I described what it was meant to the five years of foot in that same place.
It remembered that he remembered the heart of <unk> with force when you see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York City, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are <unk>
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I am always the <unk>
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get to go and get up to someone and ask him and get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs like Disney laughs like <unk> dumb dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press, you have laughter, it and <unk> and these are the attributes that associated with Parliament did not accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World New World that are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the former World Bank, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are the <unk> really important -- first of all, they provide vital vital services, <unk>
They're our <unk> of natural <unk>
We have the cadavers up to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria they help them absorb the anthrax thing that not to be by them, and caused great losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there aren't <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the <unk> symbol of the protective and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the interest and the <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian devil -- <unk>
In <unk> culture, you do a few very important <unk> in open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of endangered <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years of <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey on livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for use in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs and <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb to <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously <unk> in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a home problem is not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, I will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw it flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do, and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went back to the 21, which Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
So instead of that, everything you can do it <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where one Italians decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we got <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the River <unk> and we teach the local to grow tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were all at all interested in doing that, and so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go to --  -- we were in so fertile -- we were to have had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you what it was possible to do not <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  Let's take time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said, "My God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you have agriculture here."
I thought that only the Italians -- <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans, they were doing what the English would do, what they did and see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> Mormon missionaries and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face on the face, <unk> little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This is going to be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put this conference on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that doesn't be <unk>
I decided to just answer people, and I invented a system called the <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never happen to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? It was <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met on a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not once, but for a time, they would give them not in a <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have <unk>
So planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't even have their public meetings.
What do we do we work with one, and we work face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor, the family doctor, who sets up with you in your house, on the table of their kitchen -- and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Australia.
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this condescending crap where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year I had 27 projects on place, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so the government is <unk>   So the government says <unk> <unk> -- we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business investment in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor in philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says -- Technology is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the spirit of business.
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most popular people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk with you.
You have to give you to do it for you, privacy, have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you have to do more this morning.
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution and <unk> fossil revolution and <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a little story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered together this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move into the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk>  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States <unk> <unk> companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise, they don't come to speak with you.
And then you have to give you a dedicated <unk> service.
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic <unk> and you have to count with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We looked and looked at the 100 mining companies in the Western world, <unk> Ford, Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
I would never know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> and in bars next to their dedicated pivotal who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this <unk> someone who is talking about this <unk>
What can you do that? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> which seeks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really swap up knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give the shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music to accommodate the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most beautiful document in the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a better space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and unexpected was.
I thought a lot about death and I thought about it.
And this made me deep gratitude for time and lived and this.
It gave the significant things about the meaningful things of my life today.
But let's just keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the old old help and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her sentences for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be <unk> --  Before I die I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die. I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die of dying, I want to get married once more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hope and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they made me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center we made a kit. And now they've been <unk> in countries around the world, like South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in our age, it's more important than ever, to find ways of conserving perspective and remembering that life is brief and delicate ways.
death is something we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that make us more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is <unk> it's high and very <unk>
Not speech, but it transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
This is <unk> <unk> pass what will happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the skin color.
They don't care about religious <unk> and notice this has never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even believe it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we dug up when I was four, and I pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of <unk> <unk>
Isn't that cool?
But most people don't agree on.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal <unk> and they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
Every single individual is <unk> in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or cure yet.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play a game like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I would be pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, watching the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature -- a child that would see the world without <unk> a human being there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that are things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different does not mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be not normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on their inside and frankly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the country of the <unk>
Penn State asked me for me, a government teacher who would give up a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> indeed.
But when they develop those conversations, I felt what he would have had to have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
I was just feeling when I had those conversations with the students that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care and the health care another, and if we don't know what we don't know about it, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
So let's figure out why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we are just studying the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle for our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't they say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways of moving it into their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the language of our brain and we <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple line, which is that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you provide graphics that will apply to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help that others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the Oxford English English is <unk>
Because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public game, no matter if you wanted to do it or start, and that when you've got it, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that Parliament British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said on the camera chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the Parliament house.
They got thrown in the London Tower and she was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after the independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is going on in Congress for a long time.
You were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it the <unk> of <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about discovery of quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
All the world got tired of <unk> because this debate would be taken for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always had a <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call him an King by if he was giving him to his knees, ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> more <unk> and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would be serious about a <unk> and insignificant title like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite favorite, to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> the title of the President.
President Barack Obama has a kind of going on there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk> --  -- you may be able to stay waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the President President of the United States does not sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air and <unk> and <unk>
The reality and history have endowed with <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell me that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do to you <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually we change it much more words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground.
The air is <unk> heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see it much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and rocks <unk>
Like the others, I carry a cheap firefly in the head of light to his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
My hand was <unk> and I suddenly remember a <unk> that I met and she lost control and dropped countless meters in that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep on that hole at the same hole, their lives without pay, no reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home but they may never do it, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> at the United States <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO which is about to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not for such a grade.
When we end up talking to me I was very angry, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
You know, I even considered it my second home.
But this time, we will take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 today.
But today, you may be enslaving entire families for generations by debt, <unk> debt, <unk>
<unk> slavery generates revenues from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education promises and better work to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is happening in the <unk> the goods that are produced by slaves have value, but the ones who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like going into the ancient Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, <unk> entire families -- in a heavy canopy rainforest in their heads to 18 at the time, and they carry them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it really <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, like, my camera gets a much better treatment better than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly taken me and said, "You don't know it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that to make emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they had already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and trusted that he was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids <unk> rocks for miles on <unk> terrain to the trucks that they expected down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge them, and the kids <unk> their heads with <unk> and <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing with the <unk>
When these villagers took their freedom, the <unk> have completely <unk>
When we hear the <unk> <unk> we often think about sexual traffic and because of this world consciousness told me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously considered sex.
It took me for some <unk> <unk> that gave this dirty basement of <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local to the forced prostitution for the silence.
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of so only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> fear and, in that instant, barely able to imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs where it was <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since you touch a hard subject, it is important to point that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor by labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families who were <unk> in the trade trade.
This is a family.
Black hands are from the father, the blue <unk> and red, of red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and diving silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We hope we can get out of this house someday someday and going to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a look.
I saw what appeared to be a <unk> family on one boat, two brothers, older kids -- some more young kids -- it makes sense.
<unk> were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work <unk> over these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> it was a subject that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the <unk> trees on Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it comes to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one from the other.
It was cold and <unk>
And I really would point out that these networks weigh more than 400 kilos when they are filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will ever be because of someone who decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike. he suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
It asked us to do it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out that path barely visible and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking about an hour of a time we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team on my head as we <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> he ended up <unk> in one of of course, and we had a bunch of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children bound on their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember I looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet down to 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags of rock that then will be transported to another area where they were <unk> the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at it, we see working at least lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> by mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him on the mines.
By being killed by his uncle, she has to inherit the debt of the uncle that the force to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility to a remote possibility -- which inspires me so much respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted to know that we will give witness to them and we'll do everything that we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns a fire and that fire <unk> light about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like the management <unk>
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the email and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial sample that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet dance.
Over the last few years, it has been deeply made in the treatment.
But there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately the only way we're going to know if you actually have a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement is not biological <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never get done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do the exam to themselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars.
So what I want to do is -- as a conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the ropes.
It shows somebody healthy as it gives sounds to talk, and we can imagine as dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes.
And like they did they have a very extraordinary training level.
Let's think about time for a child to learn to speak.
And from the sound of sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as we <unk> and so as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the below, you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They make very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
And they're at the minimum cost, and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes so <unk> cost on a mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to help address.
We can reduce your patients <unk>
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for routine.
With high <unk> we could get goals.
We could make massive amounts of <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's Parkinson's Initiative <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it at the price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people will be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Right.
<unk> You can see, some people may not be <unk> They may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances that are important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion looking for the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network also, what we <unk> the project. We now have a complete <unk>
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, he was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and, in general, we avoid sunlight.
We do the beautiful models even more <unk> the perfect skin still even more perfect -- we do the impossible -- we can make it possible in the press all the time, but some of us are actually really artists with talent with many years of experience and real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the events that were going to happen in Japan.
Soon time later, a organization where it was voluntary -- there was in the place working as a part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't just sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away into the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of fish killed, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found the similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and chambers and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
So let's go through and take them to different places of the villages of all around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
Whereas the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> toilets, the gigantic huge, <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor of that day to clean up in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years of the lab, and I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had turned on the face of the girl in the face of a little bit of precision and <unk>
In another way, that girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they made a lot more pictures and got more expensive, so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we went back to <unk> a neighbor village north of <unk>
Once we use a week to use our scanner in the libraries of the temporary <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depends on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> it could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw by hand using like <unk> the areas that color and the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures long, in seawater, covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with <unk> and even with the time of time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As one time once said -- the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
I had started <unk> she had been stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face, they wouldn't have been able to reconstruct the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photographs in a fire station, between the rubble of the debris far away from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in schools in schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know they had everyone survived.
The day I gave her his photographs his youngest son was 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could see -- something that he could be able to look, something that would not have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up in there were hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- the great majority -- the great majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we might have but the first thing you might look for.
So what was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, of bringing someone to the past.
When you give a picture like this, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you get it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, to bring it up, using their talent to something that won't be thin of perfect skin.
To finish the end of this email I would like to read this email -- I went back to me, after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
And one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering a baby -- I was excited because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my newborn daughter took off the wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition on one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion people, but a billion frames per second.
So I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create videos in slow motion of the light into movement.
And so we can make cameras that you can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without <unk> and really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a <unk> <unk> it is, in various <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet player.
If we took that bullet and this <unk> pack photons and <unk> in this bottle, how does those photons spread inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light on <unk>
Now, all of this is --  -- remember, this is actually happening in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk>   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is going on to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights from the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several pictures, that <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it the same distance and we see it at slow and we see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a boring film --  -- of a slow bullet in motion.
And how do we test with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves on the table, the <unk> of the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a real composition.
But if you look at one more and more this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at India?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of a <unk> it comes back very little light up.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shorter exposure -- so barely going into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data and make it very interesting in a interesting way.
Superman can be flying.
Other heroes, can become invisible, people.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from the back to the camera.
We could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy <unk> and the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden things, but we don't know what point corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser can record a picture in denial, which, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and that we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction of our performance.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going on the <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected in the open windows of it.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood this is quite hard, so that actually this is a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> like a new mental <unk> and to solve the problems of medical health on the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he is a scientist, it turned science into art, an art of photographs.
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collected each and are not just for scientific visualization, but we can see it.
And to create a new form of computer photography with slow photography and color codes.
And let's look at those waves, remember, the time between each of those waves is just about a second.
But this is also going on.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going on.
The waves should be moving toward us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have <unk> effects. I would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you freedom.
With a mobile phone, we can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, and you can record it and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a mobile mobile.
But today, I'm talking about my mobile phone, and how my life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
databases.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer summer, the Commission on the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk>
This brings says that every European telephone company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information data.
Who's called <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use mobile phones, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their telephone company or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone service and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to her, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end, the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of all, in the end,
I'm going to get the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the beginning, I saw them and said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data <unk>
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open America. City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can come up and zoom in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you to.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It is all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other one another, and then you end up with this big network communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other, what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility of moving our lives and they want to be <unk>
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends <unk> your privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and it's not fashionable in fashion.
When you go home to their representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that are to you to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we put it all the time.

It's <unk> I'm like a blend of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The C P. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were married brothers, even though they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that occurred to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in this room today.
I'll feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go from a ride.
After Christmas, they are in the mall and they drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the C P. is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial experience.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe it <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three major sisters. If I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were convinced that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take it all the end at the end, the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used to be used was to hang a dollar in front of me so you can get it.
The <unk> that I carry in it was very heavy and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> who had received many <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family --  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign campaign.
People who grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it looked like a lot of <unk> a lot that died of starvation during the <unk>
I told you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating, so the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and I want to be <unk> so if my friends used to use <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were left in <unk>
On the summer holiday often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink milk and <unk> he got warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand foot <unk>
And now I can tell you in the head.
My parents came to this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital. Hospital.
I went to the university through the positive discrimination and I got a fellowship to the University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the work of the least smart tasks I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I made a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> very slow on Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> at the end of the end of a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, and crying up historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, and ask me why and she told me that because they did not make the stunt stunts <unk>
And I said, "Well, if I can't do stunts stunts I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper for which they literally had been born and they gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
The college was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> <unk> actors for disabled papers.
When I came back, I went home and my first tour <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
And instead, I went there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that directors of <unk> didn't make any white, not white, with disability.
It just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made me <unk>
In my first tour, it took me comics earlier in New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she went at high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs in the entire United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that small rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media media, and at the time remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma for disability.
My great chance came in 2010.
I was like invited up the news program by cable <unk> to Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to graduate dance, and I went back to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the desk of the speaker to not come out on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just kind of <unk> my whole chair.
A lot of fun that I learned right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me and as a child and no longer.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with <unk> like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone else in wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that they didn't go back, but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, to have grown up with the media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that we can create the most positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived in <unk> by the red carpet for the <unk> of the Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey in the 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the young refugees Palestinians are Palestinians a tiniest bit of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me acting live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I would like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a little village to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
The <unk> drives the little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no work, no perspectives.
He has been living in a tent, in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year or maybe a year <unk>
One day you get about a gentleman who gives him to <unk> after dinner for dinner <unk>
He meets a group of people who gives it a break.
He gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothes to buy their family home to their family.
He presented to a young man.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> an organization was connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that came off.
This was the first thing that it took him out of what we call the <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the history of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the history of 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital.
I remember sitting in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to keep a few juvenile leaders on a business top.
I went back to a few 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the major challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me that because he was a graduate university, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story do?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They are going to get young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are just searching for so desperately to be.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business programs.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent out of plastic from abroad.
If you asked someone, "When did you have the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for course, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and like he says, smell the pink pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't breed pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGOs, to work for government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and <unk>
They would take the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park Park that's how it calls it when it is created, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
He hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
I gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
It was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my father in the mountains in the mountains in the north of the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were in the way that we were the first human beings to step down that land.
We hit our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters, with apple apple with apple <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to get what they had <unk> who thought it was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how we <unk> or where do we have the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the <unk> Department of trash, and it's about 11 tons of waste.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked on his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on that for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of bringing on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of neuroscience, <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and out in traffic all the day and pass it off around you.
You just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage up.
I also learned about the relentless of the rubbish.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective form every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and its dangers inherent are <unk> in very real ways.
So we had <unk> for decades and centuries coming back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we have no space for the new reason that the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just <unk> its relationship.
And then it's what I call our daily average speed that is necessary.
And so I mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't get rid of it, and we have to clean it, or we take our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side to take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you get it?
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a pack pack of waste on the street, grabbed my little boy and went down the stairs running, and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
So shortly after that I started looking at the waste collection and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together so many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as well as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The municipal <unk> what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the <unk>
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is true naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are situated in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors, in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to come out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of crystals generates heat in the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it comes to a southern climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the ancient market that is this structure in the air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space for generating external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how do we build a building of the building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a very much growth zone in the city, where much of the buildings that we see now in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> atrium, that creates an outdoor space in the building in the building in the building and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how would the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air entrance to the air, but in a <unk> way.
We then inspire us in these beautiful ones from the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me shape the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what we <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the center of the mall because it was more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning out.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It waits for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a <unk> master plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, and I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
So during that analysis, I put special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> gates connected by almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the streets and creating 12 early blocks of the size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell cell project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make it a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then at the lower plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as I give the community about the building that is busy building it.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload and <unk> and make activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and that you have to connect nature with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of dresses until I <unk> my sinister plan.
And one day I stayed in time after the exit of the school, it was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher the book grades.
And then, I did.
And I put up the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All of these.  And I set up to bring the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other classmates, had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put every few rows of <unk> and I had a row out of it, just because of being there, you know, <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand what the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never get me wrong.
It was all <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was excited about the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, it was so good.
It brings me jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primate birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the length or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab when you study the <unk> in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no headache, <unk> would have not literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no King <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I took the lists of high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without contrast, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the adults has all of them.
This year is taken to 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the <unk> study of time -- the most popular study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We thought about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the adults that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel color, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being a teenager, and in fact, we know exactly what details about it to <unk> the knife <unk> right?
The <unk> make all of the <unk> novelists and that is something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you delight to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to you that story, and since then, <unk> says that a fresh charm that <unk> he adds up on his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so suspicious to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like great amounts of hair, and the cute little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
This is why Instagram is as successful --  <unk> links the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of childhood music, suddenly listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then that it influences those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for the truth, of the truth, a really painful thing in fact, in fact, to what to <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the pathways for the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who makes us experience, it causes us to have a much deeper range of feelings and a lot more profound and vital man that can help us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> tell us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
A day, Freud went to a very <unk> young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife would get it.
And Freud said that there was a strange thing in that man, that he didn't lie in what his wife.
So she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity and <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more we become the residents of fantasy people.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in the totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me in the age of eight, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since they were sending it a little bit of <unk> to themselves, for a year.
For a year every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
So what huge even though is <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to how does the children ask our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of diabetes, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> It's going to be <unk> or to want what you have to take out of your self and get rid of what you might ever do, and it's under the floor, and it's on your name, and it takes your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, so much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in the matter of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street Street and asked by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but bother it.
Oh, I sound so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each other puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they come in, <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to give up your hand.
It's one of the few times we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of <unk>
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
And the next minute you're the same way.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be that simple?
What if the <unk> are really an geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just fiction, <unk> jealousy.
<unk> <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying one, Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the dotcom module.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray surface of the <unk> is the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The Apollo program was the greatest rise in the history of peace in American history.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave me a few 400,000 people and asked the collaboration with 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which <unk> after death death, the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. You know, some people ask why the <unk>
Why turn it to our goal?
And you could also ask, why is the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why will fly about the <unk>
Why does it play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to transcendence the powers of technology.
They were because it was great power to do.
The landing on the moon was in a context of a long checklist of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970s, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> of Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problem that we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the global population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember looking at the Apollo 17.
And my mother was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the escape tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew vague that this would be the latest mission -- but I was completely sure I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that triggered our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists were distracted by us, and they had uranium with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that you have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when they were <unk> Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused the creation of ideas to create the creation of <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without caring for the risk, they preferred small investment investment, that they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and the development is in the long term. They have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercially immediate value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision to be popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy from renewable energy like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely financial.
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price -- don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and treaties -- <unk> the development of the <unk> energy development, a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy from the U.S. or treaties that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines with bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The Nixon president told him the War of cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> <unk> and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and you know, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be like to want to solve the problem, and the institutions must support the <unk> must be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, is it meets those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition -- like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the difficult thing and dangerous, and there is no popular science fiction mythology like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that you have about confidence.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decrease of trust, is a very widespread idea.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should be <unk>
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I bow to think that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of opinion, and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were excited about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political journalists -- they keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very safe about 20 years ago are still quite a <unk> nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is evidence for enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, they are, of course, opinions.
What else can you say?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they make some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody else would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for the question, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in others not."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to create trust in the <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a particular type of <unk> official or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left all of that knowledge when we think about trust and more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that goal I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what it is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
You know, <unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you tell it that you say, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but the trustworthiness.
So what it is about is doing a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things:
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> commodities that is responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, in contrast, they're not allowed to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will make their own <unk>
And I'm very pleased to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are critical and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> <unk> before confidence.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> going on in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system of accountability which is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> testing is actually making the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
It was all about the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are safe, and if we stop determining whether other people or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- the <unk> which is not doing properly.
Third, the task.
We went to the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately is signature because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundation enough to be trusted.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to do it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to use evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, do the common people, <unk> <unk> very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks to say I can be <unk> not to give you explanations.
I take them back and get the money, or they change it for the color that I want.
That's nice. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not really hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone to more and more and more and more, to such today as one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started imagining how it was <unk>
I first created this tool in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen it transfers its physical body to the pixel of the pixel in the pixel of the screen.
Designers can embrace their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is cut down.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital data using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, with Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
And we had a transparent bombsight with cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, and get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and I'll highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and make the digital information come to us?
So many of us have bought and returned things around the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system does understand the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so that we can make it <unk> and <unk>
How would the future be like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical game.
This magnet, <unk> is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally expand the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach it physically <unk> and at the distance, and the famous take from Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physical movement, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks of text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities of life.
As you can see, digital data is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to think about our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that we have is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes to athletes all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
And after surviving the Islamic Revolution created firmly that there was just an accurate path to the <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
Whatever I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But any adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
You know, for the rest of my life -- a second of the second class was the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> Okay.
Let's go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and much better than I <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also gave place to my reading habit of reading <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me because this is what students in China.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is all the way to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked worked for research, why do not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and politics and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to be <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of dreams, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a broken dream, it can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on my office couch and I took the shoes and told me she wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I was struck by a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could deal with.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought it to the <unk> it became easy to move your head while we get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he would say, Alex, and so I looked at her, she was right.
You start working later, they get home later, you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time for <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And so my squad <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel following the head after what they did, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign stream was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for their careers, families and future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. That's okay. <unk> the <unk> they matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be <unk>
What this means is that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments that give you your life will have gone past when you have 30 and <unk>
And more of the 40, I don't <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that they <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than in any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to the top of the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call <unk> an <unk> adolescence of <unk>
The journalists would call <unk> names, <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard Cohen said that to make big things, you need a plan, not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think that happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and this is absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, smart <unk> like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not at all.
Or they say, "Everybody says they start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better resume the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, they turned the music and all started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would go off to stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but you don't have the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of starting a career, pick a city, to choose a city, and have two to three children in a much more short period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start showing you, which is a lot more difficult and stressful to do everything in one time to the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about what it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the <unk> Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which reported more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very difficult time, his earlier life had been even more difficult.
It would often be often in our <unk> but then he got up to the day, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I just had to buy a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then she was seeing the empty space that follows after the words in case in case -- please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was their opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like for just sitting while the <unk> <unk> was going.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
<unk> capital -- I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this identity capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company that you want to try it out.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm looking at the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that to explore jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with minds with minds that are limited as much as you know what you know, how to think about it, how they think about it, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who is coming out almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call faint <unk> friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
Half the work is never <unk> so to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you didn't choose their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma will soon reach their family when they have a couple, and it exists their own family.
I told Emma, the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live right now, or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or killing time with anyone that you would belong to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, that I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
She's married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts aren't good enough.
The history of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, coming out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, the 25 or the 25 and even <unk> a good <unk> a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generations of generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> who heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital capital to use their <unk> using their weak ties choose your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very fancy job in management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to seventh grade students in New York schools.
And like any professor, I took tests and tests.
So I gave them tasks.
When I work back, I would go down grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance of <unk> scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids wasn't going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how we measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I quit the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios.
My research team and I went to the Academy of <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what we would do with the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children did as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in neighborhoods really difficult -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private, asking yourself, what of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, emerged a feature as a important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good and the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children who were more determination had significantly higher likely to get worse, even when the <unk> in every characteristic that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the test tests -- even the security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just the West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing that we know, how little science is about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a strong ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly not related or related or even correlated for dumb measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be more likely to get away when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start to start all back with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most intimate memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
And since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks like <unk> like the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking if I can cut down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic fear.
The first 200 of them will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of the web pages, or the newspapers.
Today I will start eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it is possible.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give you a ride.
<unk>
If the way in the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> from the form of calls it, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The Moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of gates of a <unk> in the old West.
I call this eight characters.
These are building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It is an astronaut as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker speaker is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two <unk> it becomes very hot.
Three of us together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out with a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, have <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters building other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is how you learn a Chinese eight years old.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is about China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician magician together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand on it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raised our children in a kind of industrial complex of child fantasy <unk>
But the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise 40 years later with, interestingly, another film that <unk> a <unk> boy and a <unk> boy would have a girl wearing a girl guard from the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling prophecy.
He had magic shoes to defeat the armies made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician is that the most wise characters and wise characters are women.
I started to notice this when I did "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years old.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk> -- so slid in the room and she was impressed as a mother left with her <unk> and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I don't think he knew everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> resilience and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke got a military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician <unk> of <unk>
How do Dorothy a movie?
And by doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to <unk> OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much as a capital force, as a force in the movies for our kids, and so little on the way of bricks of it.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the Princess <unk> does not give the right framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think that at the moment of the first kiss. I really expected them to come up because it is the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why do they stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on beating the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and I stand up to the <unk> from Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though them, they're not really their target audience.
They make a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women that write new stories for our kids, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues to be appearing on classic after classic each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and two men who they raised a young girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you -- it's available to all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic and <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character that will have lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the guy who <unk>        Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> an idea of what is a Hollywood <unk> movie.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think it was because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the crisis of <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the encouraged to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 <unk> movies how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a bigger number that it is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "That's what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted ever in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that music music music or <unk> are tightly <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male male is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, and we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools to our willingness like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would be, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want the stories to tell me about my <unk> Go and struggle and even more stories where his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things I liked was looking for some sea <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that to see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a hundred miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see differently.
I want to show you an example of how different as we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the East Delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked sight, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and processing it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape of the <unk> building materials and the ancient <unk>
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an ancient city called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere in this enormous layer of <unk>
This area is enormous -- it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, The Nile <unk> just on the side of <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved on to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try and find out at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we did the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing working jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years ago that date back from the Middle East, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a shop with <unk>
This might seem that it's not very much, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry shop showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> place in a close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire. It was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Now share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 <unk>
Do the ideas actually occur in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk>
I want you to pay the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go into their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide out against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on on your side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places that end up the bottom line.
In the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
This is waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> being tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you can go into the mouth.
It goes on the side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making the most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his middle center, singing <unk> <unk> A <unk> A <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The ground has coated with a yellow bricks path and from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of the Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping toward you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as an investigative journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and a few different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they were looking at them once.
They would have the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, this is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked her, "Do you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using old techniques invented two and a half thousand years ago, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and that academic scholars were used to memorize the <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, but a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to show Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, and it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a lot of treaties on memory written by something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as you can think about today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would argue that have changed the cognitive <unk>
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a bunch of researchers from University College from London invited a group of memory from the lab from the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference in and meaningful and significant among the brains of memory memory and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, it <unk> their brains while <unk> faces and forms of <unk> found that in the memory of memory -- different parts of the brain, different to others.
It was actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive industry is driving as an armed career where every year comes up with someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of cards -- he is about to try to memorize it in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> order of <unk> digits and <unk>
In half an hour, yes.
And while there's a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, it was absolutely all the techniques for the end of the end of the end, you reduce a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- he says the following: I mean two people who remember the same word -- I say to you -- you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you think there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later, and I ask you to <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said their work is <unk>
The same word, different than <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
It was good when they come back home to work.
You probably would have a <unk>
And when I first looked at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two and a half thousand years ago in Greece and <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the classroom was <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed us, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they wouldn't be able to give them the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped outside of the rubble, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had sat around each other.
I took the family family family where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you have to pick up, pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering or phone numbers or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have a visual memory and remarkable spatial memory.
If you tell them to give me the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very difficult to do that.
But I would bet that if you told them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse speaker in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> from images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to do it by memory, the same way that he would have done it -- if you had done it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous image -- crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine going into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about, would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like speakers <unk> <unk> their speeches -- no word for a word that is going to confuse it is typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got into that full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
It's really like looking at a lot of people sitting in taking tests. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody gets <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it is really about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
It was quite hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard business standard training team for memory.
It's a pair of <unk> and a security security bill leaving just two <unk> because the distraction.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve as good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was coming out of control.
And I won the <unk> which didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute being able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and phone lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to build <unk> of memory or memorize them <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focused on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, sort of a whole kind of attention that most of it is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
So this is how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I want to leave you with today, which I couldn't even remember that I had a memory issue, and I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even get involved in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so I just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a <unk> but I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And in my dorm room and the toilet, there was a balcony that was giving the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television -- so every time I went from my room to the toilet, all of me saw me and every time I went back, and I would come back and come back in a towel -- all of me saw.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> safe, and he hated it.
And I hate that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and in terms of those connections to emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a great thing.
architecture will determine us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it, because it was based on a half a half a half thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build homes.
You see, these stable <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they want to use shapes that are going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing -- and the red brick columns, that leave you with what they <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the <unk> the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects that constantly drives new technologies, new new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to put it back and we made it so much, that we get away from the people.
You know, all of black, this <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead, because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and go back with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we do swing the step back and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Very hard.
So we get closer to the 1980s, and we started to put these symbols.
<unk> the <unk> again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that we like and <unk>
We have neon and <unk> and we use a new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers -- that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend time in commercial centers, and we moved into the neighborhoods, and in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the French.
So maybe with a little bit of bread sticks from bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we understand memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
And architects feel frustrated and started making the <unk> step in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these very rare moments when academic and public and public and public were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up at a half a half a half thousand when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and it was all everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these are wild and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous all over the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these ways.
The very main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these ways, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon from the beginning of the new state of a new star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, which actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, all of us are photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond your physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, 100 buildings, before we know if what I designed about four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen <unk> because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until we will be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it will actually make the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charges of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly when it was finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you did the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture because digital media hasn't changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building became built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and <unk> and you are no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you're not allowed by the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from a way to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings in today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historic brick of red brick video based on the basis of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami can also serve to make a sport or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars in the community attached to that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we built.
The architects already know how to make more more <unk> more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to you.
Finally, we're not <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the way to the most pristine spaces, the local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does that very typical of the children in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
You <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, When do I have to do this?
How is we suddenly not love with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for in Google, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a bit confused because even though his mom tells him the whole while she's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
And what his mom says and what his friends, or who his friends, or fellow school people say, doesn't know who to believe.
So it makes a video of her, he publishes it in YouTube, and she asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> teenager who gets these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure pressure from being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand is <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the comments that they do.
There's no division of living in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is <unk> digitally.
What is the most important thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a particular context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the stories of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to do with what young people are <unk>
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of superheroes in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and the mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of 10 girls would rather not do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how to taxpayers society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not coming at all at the middle of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> season, if you don't think you're looking at good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, <unk> a lower note to the average of your partners who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
It turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, for me to be right, we are talking about how you see yourself not about how you are.
The lower self-esteem of his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they engage in more diet not healthy that they can bring them to a food disease.
They have self-esteem.
They're easier for the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more powerful decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, <unk> <unk> aesthetic activity, sexual relationships and no protection and damage damage.
The perfect body search is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel secure in the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not good enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, and they would have the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also an augmented impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus in six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide an education on body self-esteem that works.
One education is <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It will defy the status status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start to judge people so they are, not as you see them.
And all of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social media.
We can tell people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children grow to valuing their entire person, valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people to really make the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> his <unk>
It could be just the woman who is at two feet away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, and he would get him unable to have a long legs, more <unk> a smaller <unk> a smaller <unk> feet.
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and make his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are being transferred to all.
But let's give our children the truth.
It turns out that the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them why they are and so they do, and as they make us feel.
I went to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk to and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of the age of today, they become safe insurance agents, themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the age of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and murdering the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the Department of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially it was innocent -- but being inmate by other <unk> on the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations headquarters
Fortunately, those plans would be taken by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be done.
Later on, he would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who was <unk> with a loving American mom, teaching elementary school in elementary school, the two made it all the possible for giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims -- get to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't require much to want the same stuff in life.
And yet, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that they have to use all the possible means for everyone to live like them.
A few months before I arrest him was with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends had been going to stop training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> that without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point it to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot his little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially the goal broke on flames.
My uncle turned to the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, maybe son.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought to them so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could be <unk>
Those people later would be committed to putting a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the north River tower of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability for my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was already <unk> and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often <unk>
It was secret to my identity to avoid being the white person, but it will be the new of the silent and silent class, it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my home reading books, watching TV or playing TV games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> for growing <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
And by opera, opera, judge people, based on <unk> <unk> like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put up my way of thinking, was it during the presidential election 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the youth of youth violence like I had been entitled <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who we had done, was Jewish age.
And I took a few days to go out of the light and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came in when I got a summer job in Bush, <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out to be fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were <unk>
By the past, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I would have to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be homosexual but I know what is being asked by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation. They have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of shapes he became my figure <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
And she looked at me with the tired of somebody who has had <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that somebody else is trying to take violence, can be able to hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that even though I took me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk to those <unk> acts, like rejection of my father's actions.
So with this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent at any religion or race. The children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all indeed.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It is 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your treat.
It has emotions, anger and <unk>
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you and tea and tea.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know that I have a sense of your own.
I have no sure you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are <unk> what we got to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
<unk> in fact, is objective in nature.
<unk> in nature, is subjective people.
And so there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, it will be that vision.
Science was studying the behavior of the <unk> behavior. The neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
It was 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> -- is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> about a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling <unk> or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want consciousness to explain to consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Don't <unk> the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Now, I'm not tackling the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal film movie.
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the <unk>
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how they work, how they adapt and adapt and <unk> the living organisms, they are all questions about how they work.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a brain phenomenon, and how we think about it, how we do it, how we do it, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by an immune experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work for a long time, and I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a wonderful array of explanations -- so we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explaining biology, biology explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to deal with that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness right now, is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision from the world, but we don't know yet how.
And with an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no difficult problem in consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the mental functions, brain behaviors, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness -- based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more fundamental.
On the contrary, they look at the way, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk> <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts space, time, mass, mass law, and then <unk> the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, charge, then because of the logical stuff, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental continent, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need to do is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, the space, the mass, the physical processes.
And physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when I think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell <unk>
No, so no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have some powerful <unk> element of <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think about something so <unk>
And in part this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the awareness of the information.
There are always information processing, and there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
One very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical integration of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration, just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the gas, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually provided a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have also observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality underlying the underneath.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come out of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be made as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think you think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in terms of ethical and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has an easy information processing, so it integrated so that the answer is yes, if you're conscious.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problem on the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group -- as the audience at a TED Talk -- at the moment, we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full TED group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that needs to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing is <unk>
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those little bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will eventually be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was <unk> with my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to make it for a family prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a fractal problem.
She didn't really get nothing."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on my mom, and spent a lot of time watching the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as an achievement if we take disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't know that -- and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're not there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us about disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something called <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it can't make it <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without drawing a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with a fiber fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we will take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will bring the disability to the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you are that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they've been tackled by strangers -- expressing that you believe I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability for people with no disability.
So you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we are <unk> are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of the <unk> that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why happens.
It's because of the lying, because they have sold this lie that disability is that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And I honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, <unk> God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all over time.
But I don't realize that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a little bit of <unk> to pick up the things that fall out --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to put your battery battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad man, the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stretch of stairs hasn't done it to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a television screen, won't make the subtitles <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his dorm room watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered anything to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to step up in bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of <unk> people, and I want to live in a world where a boy of the 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> does not make us tell us, but questioning what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and <unk> <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to do it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you have to match your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running by the field of play by 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 100 pounds of 110 pounds of <unk> trying to figure out it with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you, that's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A bit of a <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk>
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans you want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called the <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! Don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller roller coaster of life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of it.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 percent, like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not yet <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. I'll give them money.
So, here is a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to get <unk>
More people saw the party because it became more exciting, faster.
In 1994, he put Schwarzschild on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to your group, and you see your next room that you see that in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
Just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties, you get <unk> like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
So how do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already been working.
And all of that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is going to take the good teams of the bad people.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would be in the <unk>
Imagine you are the field <unk>
Let's get the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor suddenly, a <unk> on the left of your <unk> of your bombsight -- you know, that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They would go to the protection.
Another <unk> you get a <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land -- but the receptor sees it in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and it can modify the career.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public audience and the fans have followed the room from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia -- trying to show you the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think about more in space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> reality gets close.
The questions that we do and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
It was recently taken after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years came to me <unk> the south end of the county of <unk> County, County, County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Ocean Ocean and the architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, chief chief to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from his openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, as it frees up from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for committing suicide.
After one every four to five to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> breaks bones, some of which are vital organs.
Most die in the impact.
The ones that not, normally they fall in the water and then <unk>
I don't believe that we have this suicide method to realize the death of suicide is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel in the bridge.
This is where most people have been to before they get life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darkest moment it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man was talking to a mate looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were born, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, boys and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on the 22 <unk> 22 year to get a call of a suicide subject -- sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up until here two times before New Jersey to try and get suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned over to the right, and it was.
This kind and intelligent guy from New Jersey had just gotten life out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had been the <unk>
damage, damage to a lot of suicide affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What do you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody would loved the <unk>
What do you say?
What does it say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending up their life, you've had these <unk>
It will be <unk> to the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and <unk> -- believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation -- and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, is I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty much <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It was never there.
I called the police police in the <unk> and he called it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came home and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been very bad without having a real mental disease.
It should not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a ticket, through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my bike.
When I saw me, he immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the hour and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his mind that day to go back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came to the <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he did that he did, and gave the hope and the life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that happened, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the events of September March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
I really struggled with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> <unk> When I went to the General San Francisco Hospital.
I know I know I had it <unk>
And Kevin is a <unk> father and the active member of the society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I will theft the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they would not think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, sleep, or drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness, and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I have been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about an hour.
During that time, I took hand for three times.
On the end of the end, he looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we have to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said to the two, the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not just connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be striving to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is hope. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior, you know what you are, and a question asks you how to get you on that?
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside was going to go back with my inner interior, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons that I'm going to stand later, when I look at this picture of me, and I think you've got this picture -- you know, <unk> it <unk>
But the October, October, I discovered that I'm just getting started.
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs that around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- a lot of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I recorded like <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom said, "Why do you always take that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how do we <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped myself share my story, not because I thought I am a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who just take me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition of culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
This is the principal of a contest of beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you engaged in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was going for the cost of <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and was a third <unk> over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from the queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when I went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my <unk> to the green card that could go to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "Do you know that if you go to the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put a two <unk> on my name.
She was also accompanied in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power or able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was going to live his truth, but <unk> he made his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All about 20 of November we make a global <unk> from the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people that <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living in my life alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here <unk> so that someday you may not have any more <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have my support network of my support network, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that sometimes that assignment, not a block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Good <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who know her for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts looked at in 2011, to the <unk> the National Prize for peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the history of the gender of inequality, the violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when they were born a little girl, his birth didn't get away.
It's not welcome, not for her father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited about having a little girl.
When it comes to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the human mother, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, stay home and the school line to their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in your adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you can ban it out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if I got the code of that course honor, honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not only the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the thought of honor.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl has to be very <unk> and very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
They are supposed to be silent and that accepts the choices of his father and his mother and the choices of the elderly -- even if they don't want to.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it or if he <unk> it with an old man, it has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same honor of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so long before I was <unk> I thought about his name, and was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so that for her.
But when I got married, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half years old and <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl on a school?"
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in Western societies, this is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
One point to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to the school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of hyperbolic Kenya, and I was in the relative part to the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that the value of my daughter.
What my father could not give to my sisters and his daughters, and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with a different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
My daughters, taught students to forget the lesson from the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were gone.
They were banned girls to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but few <unk> and it was scary to have about those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, he got up and raised for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her for New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine October 2012, shot at the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he <unk> his ear to my wife "I must <unk> why I went to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of the truth, because of the peace cause, and for the cause of education, and your daughter inspired in you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be very much for me, and I didn't ask for again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial wire was cut, I used to see a dark shadow, which was taken off by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist at the most difficult moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any girl 16 years old.
<unk> when it doesn't finish his task.
You fight with their brothers, and I'm very happy about that.
People ask me, "What is a special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google Google group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or out of my work there.
So having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a brain operation in the brain.
You're still just as smart or not?
You can't be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, he would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations of chemicals and mix out of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to keep alive.
More than I've been saved by a little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the dose dose -- because there is really no clear map that says in <unk>
I started trying to try and mix them together, and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose, dramatically my sense -- my sense of who I was me, my way to think about, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I took a dose and typical chemical dose for a <unk> man, and I was just surprised by looking at how to make my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in the sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some versions of them <unk>
It turned out like an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in the front, and it would just not happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about the men and what they have to do is they have to be better with the men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> think about almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference to how to get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and ideas were the same thing.
So today, there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the thought and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music from his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that was done by two different groups that are made in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an image for MRI MRI to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
And the middle of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you get <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same picture is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it was shown to the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions in front of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information, using the <unk> to show you what it looked like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew up <unk>
We're very close to that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it is created in the brain the same <unk>
This is taken with the brain scanning brain systems, which is available today, and their resolution a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and introduce granted.
I don't offer you that one.
A lot of people are proposing of new projection techniques for images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offered little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of times as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI was to make them really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and online online online versus FM systems.
At once, instead of a <unk> magnetic field, it will be <unk> magnetic patterns in the frequencies at the frequencies of radio <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only blood fluid, but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas into direct media.
Can we imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease.
We have a few choices to open this door.
But anyway, you choose one year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay age.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be saying to some person for the first time she loves her or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you put through in life.
And so all this is a tough conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like to happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> and I would get my head up, I would ask myself a little bit of a <unk> "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there was a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother looked a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself the next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar, but this time I was prepared and was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk>
Even an excerpt from the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
And so I took a deep down through it, and I went down and my back to my backs a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a <unk> <unk> just a <unk> <unk> just a question: "Are you <unk> or <unk>
And so I took a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a rose dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of a girl in the <unk>
And that girl looked at me with me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all it. He says, "Oh, you are a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You only know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my life is not different from you or tea or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons for why to get out of my head, it was harder than coming out of your self, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you to explain to someone who has declared him on bank harder is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell is harder to say to your five-year-old five-year-old who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the tough thing.
We must stop to classify what's hard about how hard it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our <unk> and we have just to feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what they are made out of your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't a militant lesbian <unk> to fight any child <unk>
It was frozen because of the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever ever ever ever done.
My family, my full friends, strange that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turning back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was on my sister sister.
It was the first time a lot of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my wife of lady in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and I finally went around the tables and I finally got to a place where my parents were <unk>
And after talking a moment, one of the women opted up to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program, Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to make his support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said <unk> "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how authentic it is.
That's how hard conversations are still not going to be my strong point.
Ask for anybody that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl Orchestra.
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to get out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of it.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet -- <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that the question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible, can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of computer pioneered like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you know nothing about the biology of the Earth and of neuroscience of the Earth and the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some time in time, the asteroids that are <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that we <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of potential power.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex things.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, he asked them, for several years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a Y = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a strength, F, which acts with the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the alternative choices with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, to an imminent time -- the <unk>
In a nutshell, they don't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the alternative choices.
And so having in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Let's get the human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have tendency to be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence evidence -- playing human games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that without the wrong to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a single foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for robotic robotics and human human technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Moreover, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing up with opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see the successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> education, new connections on a social network where your friends are constantly connected to and keep the net very connected.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we can organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Finally, here we see <unk> they'll spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> actions, increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk risk will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you have smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we have had all the concept of rebellion in the reverse.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
You often ask me, how do you look for goals learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of helping them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we have extended our knowledge a lot of our knowledge in the context of the universe.
And the Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is going to be that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intensity <unk> of the stars when planets go over in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
And at the time, this gives about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest record.
<unk> and ice ice that has been with us since millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused globally.
But I'm not a scientist of the weather, and I don't know.
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars with the hope of finding places in the universe, where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I'm looking for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and in spite of being a little further away from the Sun, it may be considered a potentially habitable world showing that for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, it's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now provide not just short <unk> space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the areas of our planet that still have <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places in the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen in our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization, of Mars and other planets will drag with a great and sad and sad and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know it's truly livable Earth.
And so you like exploration exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to respect humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for space exploration, and the preservation of the earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi asked, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life in alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi the time is that when civilizations become advanced enough changed to be able to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets is to protect the origin of the planets that make this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> planetary preservation can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to treat the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table table where there was <unk>
So I tried to open all the other gates and windows and they were all very closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was <unk> my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but you have no more expensive than a <unk> at the night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I was very stuck.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate increase, the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in their place, which would be going to be going to be going on bad things to happen.
Or at least if you look bad things like that, you have the probability that it's a total catastrophe going on.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that had been practicing something called me <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try and figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, we would find a place for things that are missing easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the same is the good, where the fish, that places the living trees -- where the women are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets you find your nuts.
And if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, reading reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for keys, a hook to the door, and maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular crate there.
For their reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you are <unk> it is going to always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards to drive, passport, <unk> in the mail for you to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases it.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, all of us will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear, to help them a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of making medical decisions, and in fact that it takes financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and the cholesterol is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most unequal drugs in the world today, even you might know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for which most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be in any medical procedure in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a fault of someone, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely more widely <unk> What do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before help a person?
300.
This is the research on the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why don't you do it -- <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is <unk> from the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in the five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "Good 5 is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember you under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how we can do this with the time, so they don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken it five percent of the 300 have to be <unk> and that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be able to get away by the drug that can help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic it requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the greatest men in the top of 50 percent of their prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat it is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life from pain, or a longer life that might have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is to turn out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predator and you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thought -- as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We are all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm damage, or to prevent the bad things to happen in the first place.
I went back to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the front door, and a key way of remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical man.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to be <unk>
Two <unk> even longer.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be <unk> it will never be <unk>
That is my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came out during the <unk> and over the time of time, it mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, it really lies in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a real world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules and <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand the sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't get the covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> from the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
Let's keep it going on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle <unk>
In culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to make it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I have only four lines on the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art house there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that struck me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it more about the <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and the attention I got.
And I realized that sound is like money, power -- the social currency, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a fellow listener.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to get me wrong.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like he didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers in <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to focus on <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the significance of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger while you play the piano, like facial expression, the body movement -- the speed, the shape of your hand, and so as you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it comes to just one key at once.
But the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
Uh oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and push it over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and put it in.
This is the day."
If you get it, and you get the speed, visually speed, it looks like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand -- two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> itself.
Look at <unk> <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All the hands at all.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they get very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and rich, like the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We need to begin to question what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, and I don't have to hear <unk> not to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I would like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you get everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning up each other.
The country, now I'm an adult and teach civil and invention in the Hong Kong school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait very much for my students to walk across the beach beach with lots of lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we collect these pieces of plastic to make them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it's hard for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those enormous steps.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream with invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started to build this <unk> work with <unk> <unk> so that kids can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool, and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I'll leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try and get it into something that we hope to work.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just collecting information.
By using the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get very much with the robots.
And then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are as fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light lamps and chambers on accessories and you put it into a floating robot that will move slowly into the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the chunks of plastic floating around through the sensor while the computer on board will process this picture and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
And I looked at this step step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to solve it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very enlightened kids.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they are <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using my hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water goes off, the water where they live in.
You can see that water is brown the mud and the oil also are brown color, and when it's <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there is in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm able to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe even more difficult and more close to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> and those <unk> and several cities on the East Coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power station near the water.
And today, according to the reports -- an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and drawing independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It may seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did because they are going to have to live with <unk> their entire life.
Along with them, we discussed the <unk> data, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we could notice that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the summit of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest close to the nuclear power to date.
We get closer to five miles of the nuclear station, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device as we invented and we built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem: to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so that we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal wood and chemistry, a little bit of biology -- and basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asked us things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs into new <unk> vehicles.
And plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are in our lives.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens -- scientists, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes of <unk> two radically opposite cultures <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel -- the other one of one silk dragline
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thought it would happen.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> cap he saw a figure that was to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of parts, and the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects, like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material <unk> in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts mostly like filter the other mostly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that gradually changes its functionality by variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and <unk> is shown in both screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, Why do you now?
Why wasn't it possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a price of 24 meters in diameter with a force that one day not very distant to print <unk> buildings, and graphics at the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is the only one to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion speech <unk> with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing with 3D printing we printed this layer and 3D <unk> and it will show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines rigid and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner as well.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that are allowing us to design products that <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair to the very comfortable <unk> and also it absorb sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we went back to the nature of <unk> and when design this pattern of surface <unk> becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties -- which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, involves its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree with <unk>
For that first tree, there was no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the earth made trees to grow trees with branches, and <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of a single piece of paper.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of material in the tree with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into your properties, we could generate structures that are <unk> in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We did a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we collected <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on it, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single three and a long material, 100 percent recyclable things.
When the pieces are ready, it allows them to dry it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> which first came on three three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and make it in sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more, at windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that is behaving like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed for <unk> at the sea, <unk> life <unk> and put in the ground, help you grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration, using the same design principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made it <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology, like the liquid <unk> just rather than <unk> metals and <unk> new biological leaves inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops -- <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
You turn the light into sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces a useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a only channel that looks like the nasal tract that will help us make these bacteria and that <unk> their way.
And so we started growing those channels in the human body, <unk> the material properties of material to <unk>
If we wanted to be more transparent channels.
This immune system goes down from one another, to 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our thin.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> He said, "We are fashion creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would lead the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
And so you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does it <unk> material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
The fabrication <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but from two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue, or the <unk> putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it was <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is <unk> directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we had to design these templates to be able to shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk silk and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk worms were moving into more dark areas and <unk> so we used a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the ray of light and heat heat -- distributed silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to an online farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them on the bottom of the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
And <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk -- they give the entire pavilion of its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk arm, the other one filled with empty <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is to a new design age, a new era of creation, which takes us from an inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by the design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make us care about nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever asked you to ask you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if what do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked the English, the <unk> and art and turned websites and also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And I usually like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But in the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I came up with something else, something totally different, and I would stand on it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I worried about having a fear of commitment, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have given me all the time.
They <unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned from the culture.
The first thing to ask you, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what it was that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
It goes on the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is about over and over again as you grow in different ways, you can get <unk> to high school classes, and they ask high school to ask you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before it takes us the dream.
Why?
So if this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you cannot be able to answer with 20 different things -- even though they're okay to be <unk> maybe they would be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something that you have to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what is that thing and spend your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that take a curiosity and a lot of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that would be <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
Over the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara is about us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> that you must win.
But what I've learned to talk to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interest interests in cartography, <unk> data -- math and design, as we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
This is where new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower -- it's the very rapid learning.
When we <unk> it <unk> we are interested in it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a kid pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before it turned to a writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the finest mechanics of sales when they started their practices and this ability to write the compelling about the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you want to tell you, even if at the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower <unk> is the adaptability. It means the ability to turn into whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the principal of videos -- other designer designer designer -- sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The <unk> magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they are <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, which is right now, and we need creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing what they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep down and put ideas and <unk> offers a <unk> of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are <unk> with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> most of them are <unk> to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing you can take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring is whatever it is.
If you are a heart user, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just come to realize to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I tell you, let's take your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most important -- <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> they brought them to a mutation in <unk>
<unk> <unk> I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> it until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and they found strange and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we could not give it more helps to give it more helps to give it more helps to give it a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has gone very much.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But little progress has been progress on treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists that work to find a cure for Alzheimer's Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million -- by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or to be dear with Alzheimer's.
Just in the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs of five times in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest health and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 percent death causes of all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that you cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We do understand less about Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a year of deaths like cancer.
<unk> is due to a more fundamental cause lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the years, all of us, the scientists, fatal Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only looking at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with the one of an Alzheimer's disease to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills -- the damage to the brain caused by significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules here.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds out as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happened is complex -- like defuse a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step to you and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, it has been reduced to the cords and wait for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step in order to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened to prove these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These buttons on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just an initial outcome -- but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to believe that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we <unk> it is <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have reported more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to go into the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most of a genetic disease.
The whole world with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demanding a cure.
Thank you.
I got this article in the New York Times column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
And the paper is about a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience by trying to test myself one night in the past.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more and more personal and then both look at your eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number two: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you <unk> to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> is <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or it, I know very honest with this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the immediate column, and we had a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I assume some of you may probably be wondering: keep still yet.
And the reason I think I think this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
And a week before the article was put up with a little nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had urged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I thought that my article in the New York Times would reach probably a few thousand noticed.
And that came a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was released on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had been called "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is encourage the confidence writing with respect for it to own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to find out that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on the radio and I was interviewed it.
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their lives.
In fact, the New York Times published an article by San <unk> which included the experiences of readers when they test the study in them with different levels of success.
So, my first impulse to this whole attention was to be very close to my relationship.
I said that not every request that we both did a public record together.
We have TV interviews, and <unk> orders for us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons in the <unk> process, a range of <unk> so I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really should, and I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just a adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly the wrong question.
How do we know if we were going together or not, and you get <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher wasn't producing romantic love.
Rather than that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, between medical students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants became closer after doing that, several <unk> studies, as well as the <unk> protocol used to be able to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the police members and the community, and they've used it among people from the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tested last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately it never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person who I <unk>
Well, he paused the <unk>
I think she only wants us to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better about getting better than testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was supposed to be all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or could I live without him.
So I went into science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I only was looking for the book that I was writing -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm reasonably looking for is sometimes more than reasonably allowed to demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep <unk> in the person I love you I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether they were together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk and this is a very scary story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still with together?
And his content with a <unk> answer or No.
So more than a question, let me ask you more difficult questions, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't you?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut out and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good beginning to have a more egalitarian conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following us together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- "Love didn't happen.
<unk> fell because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times would we have to make that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we <unk> and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to the title of my article -- which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I became like a forest <unk>
And one of the city in New York ago, a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a ticket to a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species -- ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from traveling and <unk> and <unk> and all these <unk> things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to the bees, and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could be <unk>
Instead, the opposite of the opposite happened, somehow it seemed to grow the size of size, as if it was that they would play the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to get me and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow out to draw you from drawing just like a body on the scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens.
First of all, we will be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very much fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to ride exhibitions and those things, and I was winning some money to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of resin from human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, like the drawing on a window, and then in another window, and another window, and it had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition, on.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're going from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are <unk> <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a yellow god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Of course, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is coming out and clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> to keep the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look at the <unk>
It's a little bit an narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird peak and spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> feet over a snake line that unites the <unk>
But anyway, its tail turn to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up on a eyeball of <unk> that was made out of terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards for terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file of a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four at the time.
They're like cells, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting me together.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 kilos with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> He's the chest, you can get <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall which comes out of your chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this weird statue
There's a little forest that is inside the cavity <unk>
Can you <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a painter, a painter, a musician, a radio, by radio, a museum, a school, an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries countries, in the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made in the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start swap those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
Take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will cause any effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take <unk> drugs, these are <unk> to lower the number of viruses in the blood, and will increase the cells of <unk> cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on its side effects on its most negative effects because in the time you get to the blood stream, it will be <unk> and worse in the time that you can get to your destiny, which is more important to the warehouse of HIV.
These are brain regions like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get into the bloodstream.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great deal of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment for life run by an oral advantage.
And one day, I sat down, and I thought, "Hey, do we get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> from the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you're used in <unk> for health care and surgery that can be used for anything else, including transportation transportation of medicine.
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open or <unk> holes extremely small, that open and closing almost immediately cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam on the cell membrane on the cell membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realized, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this in vitro technology, or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, that's our laser, we'll do a <unk> at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it's going to go from the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which releases it directly into the infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look very much like that.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been looking at armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these facilities officers and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent involvement in violent confrontation for nonviolent participation.
I do field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-state actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any conflict of successful conflict process.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political struggle will be <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent volunteer against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social service network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking everywhere.
We would have a complex machine, a complex machine, of radio, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex income of funds without <unk> but through business -- for example, building action.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to better recruit and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state didn't have security and protection.
The <unk> of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups to deliver safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price price.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in the Palestinian showed, cannot be understood by the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, only we think about violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated ones are these organizations, fewer can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, and they run all their function, they collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations, and <unk> and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East today, more <unk> and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in <unk> tools.
<unk> that <unk> government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand the <unk> groups -- we will understand better what incentives to provide the transition from violence to nonviolence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battle, but it will not give us stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety <unk> to fill that government gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label on <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I thought about it as a feminist feminist.
Or at least I wrote a piece, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and to use sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that I could be feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I <unk> as a woman who is not following the rules, which is about too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine it to be another person.
With the time, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, Marie and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I want the same job at the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as well as <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it very easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing to <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in mind our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills, and much more.
We need to have to realize these differences and how we engage ourselves in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear music rap <unk>
Even though the letter <unk> to women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin emerged from the yin emerged -- it's amazing.
<unk> reality with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass, the <unk> of the grass, and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion journals and <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this very same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable to when they were <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color women of color, the gay working and <unk> for women, white and high middle class.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist ...
It also happens is this: <unk> <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would love perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of love from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I think I think I think that <unk> before I try to put it there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that means, by fear of not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little realistic expectations to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a little realistic expectations to be able to be able to be able to get
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last years it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star of pop-up <unk> openly Feminism and making women and young men that being feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless debates if they were <unk> it was a feminist.
It will be his truth in terms of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go much beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad truth is, or a more <unk> Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give the day, go to action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier than happy -- providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does her music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad choices are built, this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to us and is our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old <unk>
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant girls and so brave. I want to grow in a world.
where they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice to become as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> <unk>
We can change the app app when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't have a number enough of women, so much to participate in it as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts without adopting these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power directors and movie producers and music producers that can make great decisions and more courageous, to create a durable and significant.
We can also argue with bravery our differences, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, above all, because I got my voice to me, and Feminism was helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
And a few kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't bother believing it could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I got myself in a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And I also found that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue, the grim reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need from such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> because we had been exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border, with Canada, to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with a immune system is one of the most easily consistent diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines are disqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world continue to make sure that vaccines will put their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it was to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable by three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds like <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could take another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
So if you ask people from the Center for Disease Control, and what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and <unk> and "A <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how that story was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young people who looked like a private worlds -- <unk> people around their own parents.
They could make fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey for <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the topic, stated that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome? As far as South Africa of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He was once convinced that he had turned nine from every 10 kids sent by the other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child is caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been very carefully in a refrigerator that didn't happen.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they organized in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two to two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents' parents desperately to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> and <unk> and had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as black-eyed Susie! No special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Science Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They ran a general prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb in London called <unk> to try and find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> diverse and diverse lives.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In the other way, these children didn't fit into beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody didn't realize these children before?
But then I came up with a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was German, and he <unk> him for it.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for children teaching children of learning were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with early exercises.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces throughout the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and they started to help in the developing methods of education that were particularly suited for them.
I have <unk> <unk> as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of harm and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in biblical culture like the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes went into <unk> putting the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk>
These changes have broken <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked on <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four prizes of the <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and parents around the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact hoped that they were hoping that the people with autism, and their families will finally support the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful story -- and <unk> a very bad credible history that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of preventing prevention that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's the right -- the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, people have <unk> on the Internet to refuse the idea that are the puzzles to solve the new advances in medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with functions, doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most infectious aspects of autism are in the understanding of the teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
